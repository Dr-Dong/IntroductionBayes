This tutorial provides a practical introduction to fitting LMMs in a Bayesian framework using the probabilistic programming language Stan. We choose Stan (rather than WinBUGS or JAGS) because it provides an elegant and scalable framework for fitting models in most of the standard applications of LMMs. We ease the reader into fitting increasingly complex LMMs, first using a two-condition repeated measures self-paced reading study, followed by a more complex $2\times 2$ repeated measures factorial design that can be generalized to much more complex designs.}

  abstract = {This is the first attempt at characterizing reading difficulty in Hindi using naturally occurring sentences. We created the Potsdam-Allahabad Hindi Eyetracking Corpus by recording eye-movement data from 30 participants at the University of Allahabad, India. The target stimuli were 153 sentences selected from the beta version of the Hindi-Urdu treebank. We find that word- or low-level predictors (syllable length, unigram and bigram frequency) affect first-pass reading times, regression path duration, total reading time, and outgoing saccade length. An increase in syllable length results in longer fixations, and an increase in word unigram and bigram frequency leads to shorter fixations. Longer syllable length and higher frequency lead to longer outgoing saccades. We also find that two predictors of sentence comprehension diffi- culty, integration and storage cost, have an effect on reading difficulty. Integration cost (Gibson, 2000) was approximated by calculating the distance (in words) between a dependent and head; and storage cost (Gibson, 2000), which measures difficulty of maintaining predictions, was estimated by counting the number of predicted heads at each point in the sentence. We find that integration cost mainly affects outgoing saccade length, and storage cost affects total reading times and outgoing saccade length. Thus, word-level predictors have an effect in both early and late measures of reading time, while predictors of sentence comprehension difficulty tend to affect later measures. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration using eye-tracking that both integration and storage cost influence reading difficulty.},

  abstract = {We report a comprehensive literature review of retrieval interference in reflexive-antecedent dependencies, number agreement, and non-agreement subject-verb dependencies, and computationally evaluate the predictions of cue-based retrieval theory with reference to published results. A novel finding from the review and modeling is that, contrary to claims in the literature, results on number agreement are not entirely compatible with cue-based retrieval theory. We also show that the cue-based retrieval account in its current form cannot explain several reported interference effects, such as (i) speed-ups observed in presence of a syntactically unlicensed distractor when the correct dependent is a full match to the retrieval cues and (ii) slow-downs when the correct dependent only partially matches the retrieval cues.  We demonstrate that these effects can be explained by two theoretical and independently motivated constructs: distractor prominence and cue confusion. The cue-based retrieval model is therefore extended to incorporate distractor prominence and cue confusion, and quantitative predictions are derived from this extended model. We show that the extended cue-based retrieval model provides a better explanation of published results than the classical retrieval account.},

journal = {Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science},
publisher = {John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},
issn = {1939-5086},
abstract = {Eye movement data have proven to be very useful for investigating human
sentence processing.Eyetracking research has addressed a wide range of questions,
such as recovery mechanisms following garden-pathing, the timing of processes
driving comprehension, the role of anticipation and expectation in parsing, the
role of semantic, pragmatic, and prosodic information, and so on. However, there
are some limitations regarding the inferences that can be made on the basis of eye
movements. One relates to the nontrivial interaction between parsing and the eye
movement control system which complicates the interpretation of eye movement
data. Detailed computational models that integrate parsing with eye movement
control theories have the potential to unpack the complexity of eyemovement data
and can therefore aid in the interpretation of eye movements. Another limitation
is the difficulty of capturing spatiotemporal patterns in eye movements using the
traditional word-based eyetracking measures. Recent research has demonstrated
the relevance of these patterns and has shown how they can be analyzed. In this
review, we focus on reading, and present examples demonstrating how eye movement
data reveal what events unfold when the parser runs into difficulty, and how
the parsing system interacts with eye movement control},

 title = {The subject-relative advantage in {C}hinese: {E}vidence for expectation-based processing},
 abstract={Chinese relative clauses are an important test case for pitting the predictions of expectation-based accounts against those of memory-based theories. The memory-based accounts predict that object relatives are easier to process than subject relatives because, in object relatives, the distance between the relative clause verb and the head  noun is shorter. By contrast, expectation-based accounts such as surprisal predict that the less frequent object relative should be harder to process. In previous studies on  Chinese relative clause comprehension, local ambiguities may have rendered a comparison  between relative clause types uninterpretable. We designed experimental materials in which no local ambiguities confound the comparison. We ran two experiments (self-paced reading  and eye-tracking) to compare reading difficulty in subject and object relatives which were  placed either in subject or object modifying position. The evidence from our studies is consistent with the predictions of expectation-based accounts but not with those of memory-based theories.},

  abstract = {We provide an introductory review of Bayesian data analytical methods, with a focus on applications for linguistics, psychology, psycholinguistics, and cognitive science. The empirically oriented researcher will benefit from making Bayesian methods part of their statistical toolkit due to the many advantages of this framework, among them easier interpretation of results relative to research hypotheses, and flexible model specification. We present an informal introduction to the foundational ideas behind Bayesian data analysis, using, as an example, a linear mixed models analysis of data from a typical psycholinguistics experiment. We discuss hypothesis testing using the Bayes factor, and model selection using cross-validation. We close with some examples illustrating the flexibility of model specification in the Bayesian framework. Suggestions for further reading are also provided.},

  note ={Special Issue on Encoding and Navigating Linguistic Representations in Memory},
  abstract={We examined the effects of argument-head distance in SVO and SOV languages (Spanish and German), while taking into account readers’ working memory capacity and controlling for expectation (Levy, 2008) and other factors. We predicted only locality effects, that is, a slow-down produced by increased dependency distance (Gibson, 2000; Lewis & Vasishth, 2005). Furthermore, we expected stronger locality effects for readers with low working memory capacity. Contrary to our predictions, low-capacity readers showed faster reading with increased distance, while high-capacity readers showed locality effects. We suggest that while the locality effects are compatible with memory-based explanations, the speedup of low-capacity readers can be explained by an increased probability of retrieval failure. We present a computational model based on ACT-R built under the previous assumptions, which is able to give a qualitative account for the present data and can be tested in future research. Our results suggest that in some cases, interpreting longer RTs as indexing increased processing difficulty and shorter RTs as facilitation may be too simplistic: The same increase in processing difficulty may lead to slowdowns in high-capacity readers and speedups in low-capacity ones. Ignoring individual level capacity differences when investigating locality effects may lead to misleading conclusions.},

        abstract = {The analysis of experimental data with mixed-effects models requires
decisions about the specification of the appropriate random-effects structure.
Recently, Barr, et al 2013, recommended  fitting `maximal'
models with all possible random effect components included.  Estimation of
maximal models, however, may not converge.  We show that failure to converge
 typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is
a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly
supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum
likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly
informative priors.  Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization
may lead to uninterpretable models.  We provide diagnostic tools for detecting
overparameterization and guiding model simplification.  Finally, we clarify
that the simulations on which Barr et al. base their recommendations are
atypical for real data.  A detailed example is provided of how subject-related
attentional fluctuation across trials may further qualify
statistical inferences about fixed effects, and of how such nonlinear effects
can be accommodated within the mixed-effects modeling framework.}
