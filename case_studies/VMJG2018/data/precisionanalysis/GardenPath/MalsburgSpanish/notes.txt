tid: trial id
wid: word id
word: the word
fstart: start time of the fixation
fstop: end time of the fixation
x, y: coordinates of the fixation in pixels
p: pupil size (in area unit)
subj: subject
expt: experiment
item: item
cond: condition
acc: accuracy of the response to the comprehension question
RCR: cornea reflex threshold
RP: pupil threshold
dur: duration of the fixation
rid: region id, same regions as in Meseguer et al.
nw: number of words in sentence
rid2: region id, same as Meseguer et al. except that the last word
constitures a region of its own (10)

cond a: garden-path condition
cond b: preferred structure is correct
cond c: non-ambiguous

fe: fixation data, new columns are:
 cr is the id of the critical word
 pr is the pupil size after some correction procedures (removed
variance stemming from changes of cornea reflex and pupil threshold
during the experiment, see
https://141.89.100.178/labwiki/PupilloMetry).  Use this instead of p.
 nw is number of words
 sess is the session

fe.em.rid: emed version of fixation data.  I used regions รก la
Meseguer et al instead of words.
fe.em.rid2: emed version of fixation data.  I used regions รก la
Meseguer et al + last word region (10).
fe.em.wid: emed version of fixation data, this time with words instead
of regions.

tinfos: trial attributes
 pr is the pupil size at the beginning of the trial
 # no of fixations in the trial

sinfos: subject attributes
 cvis: lenses, glasses?
 alc: alcohol in the last 24 h
 hsleep: hours of sleep last night
 nt: number of trials (including practice and fillers)
 p: pupil size on average
 pcu: working memory score
 acc.wm: accuracy in the distractor task in the wm test

As far as I can see, pupil size is not correlated with anything.
Didn't try a lot of things, but this would be fairly disappointing.
