Here you have three data.frames.

fer8 contains the target fixations of the first regressions from region 8.
fer9 and fer10 contain the same but for regressions from region 9 and 10.

To get an idea of what's going on:

load("first_regressive_fixations_from_r8_r9_r10.Rda")

fe <- fer8
barplot(tapply(fe$rid, list(fe$cond, fe$rid), length),
       beside=T, leg=T, args.legend = list(x = "topleft"))

fe <- fer9
barplot(tapply(fe$rid, list(fe$cond, fe$rid), length),
       beside=T, leg=T, args.legend = list(x = "topleft"))

fe <- fer10
barplot(tapply(fe$rid, list(fe$cond, fe$rid), length),
       beside=T, leg=T, args.legend = list(x = "topleft"))

I'm not sure about how to do the inferential statistics.  For region 2
we could do this:

 fe <- fer8
 fe$target.is.2 <- fe$rid==2
 lmer(target.is.2 ~ cond + (1|subj) + (1|item), fe, fam=binomial())

But this doesn't answer our question (Are regression targets shifted
to region 2 and 6 in condition a vs. b and c?), because this way we
get a significant diff even if there are simply more regressions to
*all* targets in condition a.  So we have to model not absolute
occurrences of a target but the proportion of regressions to region 2
compared to regions 1 and 3--7.  I don't have a good idea how this can
be done using a mixed model.

Note that Meseguer et al. analyzed only regressions starting on 9
because on 8 there weren't many.  Mitchell et al. looked at
regressions from the critical word and the following region separately
if I recall correctly.
